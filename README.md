# What is this
I wanted to learn F# and so decided that this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) was a good opportunity to do that.
So this repo is my solutions (at least some of the problems) to that challenge written in F#.
Since this is my first experience with F#, it may not be the highest quality or idiomatic code.
